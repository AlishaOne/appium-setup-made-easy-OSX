## Appium setup made easy

Appium is an open source, cross-platform test automation tool for native, hybrid and mobile web apps, tested on simulators (iOS, FirefoxOS), emulators (Android), and real devices (iOS, Android, Windows, FirefoxOS). The hassle free shell script (.sh) file will help you set up Appium on OSX.

## REQUIREMENTS

Your environment needs to be setup for the particular mobile platforms that you want to run tests on.

1. You will need node.js and npm v6 or greater (use [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or brew install node to install Node.js. We recommend the latest stable version.
2. JDK 1.8 or above (require for Android). Set 'JAVA_HOMEâ€™ to be your JDK path. The bin in that directory should be added to your PATH variable.
